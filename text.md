# 2016

We met online and and in person and the sand blew us from the beach to the park and the bar and finally to your house, where I somehow missed my train..

# 2017

We camped and explored California's beauty and biked around Trump protests in Portland, unbeknownst to us that we'd raise a child here.  We also expanded our little family of two into three, by adding a small psycho

# 2018

We left the big city and moved across the bay, continued our hikes and started the long road of adding 'trying' to add another family member.

# 2019

Our little family grew by 1, a tiny and hopelessly adorable combination of you and I

# 2020

We briefly expanded our little family by 5 and then .. chickened out.  Explored Portland once again as the world socially distanced

# 2021

We made the migration to the great Pacific Northwest and bought a house that was orange, inside and out.

# 2022

Expanding our outdoors exploration to the Northwest, we did what all Portlanders do, hunt waterfalls!  Also, I broke my leg.

# 2023

We packed more and more into the 4Runner, and you learned how to cut bangs.  We started making 'friends with kids'

# 2024

We were cold.  We were warm.  Sierra performed in dubious dress.

# 2025

New beaches, new countries, Sierra started school!

# 2026

And here we are; 10 years into making families, memories, house upgrades, stories, bread, sauna.  It's been awesome making this life with you; thank you for giving me all this!
